## 7. Пакет для релиза

Создайте `build.js` для сборки:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs-extra');
const zip = require('adm-zip');

// Копируем файлы в dist
fs.copySync('.', 'dist/fateful-tarot', {
  filter: (src) => !src.includes('node_modules') && !src.includes('.git')
});

// Создаем zip
const zipFile = new zip();
zipFile.addLocalFolder('dist/fateful-tarot');
zipFile.writeZip('fateful-tarot.zip');

console.log('Модуль собран!');
